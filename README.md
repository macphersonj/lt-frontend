# Linktree Frontend Test

:bell: **_Note:_** on load, the app will randomly fetch one of two user profiles. One is styled with the 'default' theme and the other is user-styled - please refresh to see the differences :bell:

This app is by no means finished - there are some TODOs in the code - but a brief list includes:

- Global default theme styling and abstracting all font styles
- Far greater and more in-depth test coverage needed
- Embedded music player is non-functional, nor does it switch platforms
- Icon set is static, which would need to be made dynamic for a production build

Thanks for your consideration!
